# Bochs (with options)
This repository is a tap for [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) for [Bochs](https://bochs.sourceforge.io) with options. If all you need is a basic Bochs installation it is available in homebrew-core and this tap isn't needed.  

## How do I install Bohcs using this formula?
To install without options use:
`brew install victorzimmer/bochs/bochs-full`

To install using options use:
`brew install victorzimmer/bochs/bochs-full --with-debugger-gdb-stub --with-x11` of course replacing with any options use desire.

## Using GDB as debugger for Bochs
The motivation to create this repository came from a need to use GDB as a debugger for Bochs.
The documentation for doing so can be found [here](https://bochs.sourceforge.io/doc/docbook/user/debugging-with-gdb.html)
I also found that on macOS LLDB can be used instead of GDB for this purpose, and it was already installed.

## Thanks to
Most of this formula is a straight copy from [homebrew-core/bochs](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/3da452e587aa6863865b1692e9ccb01d3f0befcf/Formula/b/bochs.rb), I've only added the options dcoumented above.
